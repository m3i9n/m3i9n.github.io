                    <p>Makoto Yukimura, born May 8, 1976, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan, is a Japanese manga artist best known for Vinland Saga. 
                        He used to be an assistant of Shin Morimura.</p>
                        
                    <h1>Early life</h1>
                        <p>Yukimura considered himself a laidback child at school. 
                            His first manga was Akira Toriyama's Dr. Slump at 5 and was particularly impressed by the cover. 
                            He then watched the anime much to his surprise because he did not see the need of a story being repeated. 
                            When Yukimura became 16, he had the idea of becoming a manga author. During his early life, Yukimura was nearly killed in two car accidents. 
                            This made him reconsider his way of thinking. He believes he had no social life and barely paid attention to classes in his childhood.
                            The only thing he wrote in his notebook was manga.</p>
                        
                    <h1>Career</h1>
                    <h2>Planetes</h2>
                    <p>He made his debut in 1999 with the manga Planetes in Kodansha's Morning magazine. 
                        The manga ended in 2004 and spanned 4 volumes. In 2003 the manga was turned in a 26-episode anime.
                        In 2002 the manga received the Seiun Award for best science fiction series, and in 2005 the anime also received the same award.</p>

                    <h2>Because Goodbyes Are Coming Soon</h2>
