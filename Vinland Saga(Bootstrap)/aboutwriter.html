                        <p>Makoto Yukimura, born May 8, 1976, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan, is a Japanese manga artist best known for Vinland Saga. 
                            He used to be an assistant of Shin Morimura.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h2>Early life</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <div class="well">
                        <p>Yukimura considered himself a laidback child at school. 
                            His first manga was Akira Toriyama's Dr. Slump at 5 and was particularly impressed by the cover. 
                            He then watched the anime much to his surprise because he did not see the need of a story being repeated. 
                            When Yukimura became 16, he had the idea of becoming a manga author. During his early life, Yukimura was nearly killed in two car accidents. 
                            This made him reconsider his way of thinking. He believes he had no social life and barely paid attention to classes in his childhood.
                            The only thing he wrote in his notebook was manga.</p>
                        <p>Yukimura was first inspired to become a manga artist after reading Fist of the North Star as a boy.
                            He said he had always wanted to produce a series which reflected the same themes of "strength and justice". 
                            However, he felt that he would not accomplish his dream due to poor academic skills. 
                            Eventually, he started studying manga at 16 and was recruited as an assistant two years later. 
                            His parents convinced him of graduating first from high school. He never drew manga on his own until his debut. 
                            Once graduating from college at 22, he met Kaiji Kawaguchi who found his potential to become a manga author. 
                            He met Dai Morimura who taught him about drawing manga and find his own style rather than imitating others. 
                            Yukimura got married during his work as an assistant who supported him.[4] In regards to his family, Yukimura mentioned he has two children 
                            with the second one being born in 2006.With the later birth of another child, Yukimura revealed that all were male but was worried 
                            about their health</p>
